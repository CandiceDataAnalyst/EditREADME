## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Superstore is a retail company with a widespread presence throughout the United States. They specialize in selling furniture, office supplies, and technology products. This summer, they hired me as a Business Intelligence Analyst at their Seattle office. My role is to identify weaknesses and opportunities in their marketing performance with the aim of enhancing Superstore's business growth and productivity.

## DATASET:
The dataset was sourced from the HiCounselor website. To view or download the cleaned dataset, you can check my repositories on GitHub.

The dataset contains 9993 sales transactions that occurred from 2019 to 2022. It encompasses a wide range of information, including the specifics of the order, geographical information, and particulars about the products ordered. There are no missing values or any irrelevant data types and values. During the inspection process, one duplicate entry was identified and removed. Therefore, the dataset maintains full accuracy and integrity, making it suitable for further analysis.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The KPI section provides a snapshot of the superstore's overall performance. It indicates a substantial sales figure of $2.3 million and a profit of $286.41K. The store has processed a total of 5009 orders involving 38,000 quantities of products.
Sales by Region
This section breaks down the sales figures by different geographical regions. The West region leads with sales amounting to $725K, followed by the East ($678K), Central ($501K), and South ($392K) regions.
Sales vs. Profit by Category
Here, we see a detailed breakdown of sales, profit, and quantity of products sold across three main categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology. The Technology category stands out with the highest sales and profit figures, despite having a lesser quantity of products sold compared to Office Supplies.
Sales vs. Profit by Sub-Category
This section offers a deeper dive into the sales and profit figures across various sub-categories. While "Phones" and "Chairs" have the highest sales, "Copiers" yield the highest profit. It is worth noting that the "Tables" and "Bookcases" sub-categories are operating at a loss, with negative profit values.
